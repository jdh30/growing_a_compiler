= Growing an Arm Compiler using OCaml

# Static generation of assembly
# Dynamic generation of an int
# Add and putchar
# Sub (make sure the order of operands is correct)
# Variables: let bindings and variable lookup


== To do

* Functions: definitions; arguments from registers or stack; calls and calling conventions
* Conditional execution
* Arrays
* Read and write
* Virtualize the stack and put top elements in registers when possible
* Use liveness analysis to reuse registers
